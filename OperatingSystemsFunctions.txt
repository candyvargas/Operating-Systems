Android was my favorite pperating systmes until i gave iOS a chance. What i like about android is that it has a massive amount of free applications.
It also allows you to add external memory is case you need additional memory to save books, photographs, videos, or document files.
Now that I have tried the iOS operating system and i really like it because of the security system it provides. I feel safe against virus, malware and personl 
theft identity. I also really like the camera proformance.
Windows for me has been the easiest to navigate. The start menu helps locate programs, files or apps quickly. Cartona is also a nice feature that Windows offers.
